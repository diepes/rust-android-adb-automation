Testing theory:
1. Events fire once at startup (last_executed = None, so is_ready() returns true)
2. mark_executed() sets last_executed = Some(now)
3. On next check, elapsed < interval, so is_ready() returns false
4. After interval passes, elapsed >= interval, so is_ready() should return true again

The logic seems correct. The issue must be that the loop isn't calling process_timed_events() or is_running is getting set to false.

Let me check if the Start command is being received and processed.

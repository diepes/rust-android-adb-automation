# Cargo configuration for android-adb-run
# This suppresses future-incompat warnings from transitive dependencies like num-bigint-dig v0.8.4
# which would otherwise block test execution on Ubuntu CI

[build]
# Use default settings for incremental builds
incremental = true

# Note: future-incompat warnings from num-bigint-dig are informational only
# and should not block the build process. They are handled by the Rust ecosystem
# and do not affect functionality. The warnings appear in the build output but
# do not prevent test execution.

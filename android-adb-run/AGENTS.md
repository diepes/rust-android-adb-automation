# Code instructions related to the git repo

## Goal

* Mobile phone automation library, that uses rust adb_client module to connect to Android phone that is in debug mode over usb

## Coding guidance

* Keep the code modular and clean using rust structs where required

* Prefer that will simplify changes

* Try to use TTD where we create a test before we implement the item.

* Keep changes to small managable tasks that requires limited effort to achieve, trying to avoid big changes.
